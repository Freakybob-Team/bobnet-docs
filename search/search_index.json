In order to make your own JSON, you need: - Something that lets you deploy websites (ex: GitHub Pages) - JSON knowledge Ready? First, make a folder. Name it anything you want, it doesn't matter, as long as you can deploy it to the internet. Create a JSON file. Call it anything you want, it doesn't matter. Next, you can start making your JSON! It needs to be a specific structure for our clients. Here's an example (which is the official JSON from 9/28/25): { \"sitelink\": [\"intro_site/bob.html\", \"know_your_stuff/index.html\", \"https://freakybob.site\", \"https://fs.freakybob.site\", \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"], \"sitename\": [\"hi.bob\", \"know.bob\", \"freaky.link.bob\", \"fs.link.bob\", \"rick.roll\"] } As you can see, the sitelink that's 1st goes with the 1st sitename (ex: intro_site/bob.html is 1st sitelink, and hi.bob is 1st sitename). You can set it up like that, and you'll have a compatible JSON. You can deploy it to the internet in any way you'd like, but we use GitHub Pages . Last, you can use it on supported clients. For our client, you can click \"use custom JSON source (for experienced users)\" and put in your URL. [!WARNING] Custom JSON in our web client has not been tested yet.
