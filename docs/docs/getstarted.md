# Getting Started
To get started with BobNet, download a client of your choice. At the moment, [BobNet Web (by us)](https://freakybob-team.github.io/bobnet/) is the only choice.

The first site you should visit is hi.bob, which has credits and lets you know its working.

Next, do whatever you'd like. BobNet is at an early stage in its development, and currently is designed for developers, not end-users.
